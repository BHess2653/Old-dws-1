		<ul>
			<li>The <abbr title="Architeuthis">giant squid</abbr> is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species.</li>
			<li>Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see Deep-sea gigantism): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms).</li>
			<li>The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</li>
